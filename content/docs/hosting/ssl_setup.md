Generate CSR on the server with this cmd (console):

```

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydomain.key -out mydomain.csr

```

Note: it is good to specify the whole path, otherwise it will generate to the path where you ran the command

```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Dublin
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Dublin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Alarmcontrol24
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Alarmcontrol24
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:alarmcontrol24.ie
Email Address []:lubos@matrixinternet.ie

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```

paste the generated CSR content to "add your CSR" textarea on the geotrust page

add SANs record (www.domain.com) - so common name will be domain.com (autogenerated from CSR) and the one to be added as SANs is 

www.domain.com

Verification - File

Note: Dont forget to verify with the fileauth.txt (download the file from GeoTrust and upload it to server)  if you chose this option


## APPLYING THE CERT

Open the domain.ssl.conf (alarmcontrol24.ie.ssl.conf on this instance) on server (usually at /etc/apache2/sites-available) and point to the generated files

```
#   SSL Engine Switch:
#   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
SSLEngine on

#   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
#   the ssl-cert package. See
#   /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz for more info.
#   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
#   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
SSLCertificateFile /var/www/alarmcontrol24.ie/ssl/alarmcontrol24_ie.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /var/www/alarmcontrol24.ie/ssl/alarmcontrol24.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /var/www/alarmcontrol24.ie/ssl/alarmcontrol24_ie_chain.crt
(the chain file is optional)
```

Note: if there is a chain cert file you need to point to it too

Restart apache (console)

```
service apache2 restart

```
