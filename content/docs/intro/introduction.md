Some Kind of Intro to the docs here

## Get started

How to Use These Docs

1. Its OK to copy and paste, we are not interested in Rankings

## Rules

1. Keep it Succinct and to the Point

2. If you want to give deeper explanations use the Blog -see the example

3. It should be almost in step by step format, think how if you were building it for first time with no Experience 

4. If there are 10 ways to do something choose the most common way, we can always use Google

5. etc etc

## To Dos / Change Requests

1. We need Better Tagging for Search - Search is only finding titles on the left, not on the right menu.
