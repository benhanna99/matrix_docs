## Create a MYSQL Dump via SSH

[How to make a MYSQL Dump with Command Line](https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-backup-and-restore-mysql-databases-using-the-mysqldump-command/)


We need to enter our relevant MYSQL database details into the brackets below. 

These can usually be found in a config.php or database.php file. For example, for a Wordpress website, the details could be found in wp-config.php

So it would look like this:


```

mysqldump -u [USERNAME] â€“p [DATABASE NAME] > [ARCHIVENAME.sql]


```

AND This is what we would paste in to our terminal (no brackets)#

Obviously replace the words in caps below with your correct details:

```

mysqldump -u USERNAME -p DATABASE NAME > ARCHIVENAME.sql

```

You will then be prompted to enter the password


The database dump can be downloaded via SFTP/FTP if we go back to the root folder (might need to refresh FTP Client)
